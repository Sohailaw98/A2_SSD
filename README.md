Soooo we find ourselves here now,

We decided to follow the Django tutorials hosted by Corey Schafer on youtube and had a hardtime keeping up
since it was the first time we were using python for web-app dev.

To cut things short we were able to 

#### -distinguish between a user and an admin allowing the admin access to all the other users 
#### pastes,profiles and personal information using another portal.
 
#### -all public posts can be easily accessed by everyone 

#### -login/logout functionality for both users and admin

#### -resetting the password by sending an email to the account provided during registration

#### -generating our own SSL cert using stunnel

#### -shortening urls 

#### -hashing password while storing in the database

#### -using cron jobs to make sure the database is always being backed up every 15 mins

#### -we have used version control extensively and our commits can viewed publically

#### -we have attempted to use apt visual desgin to make it more appealing
