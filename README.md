Secure Pastebin

Soooo we find ourselves here now,

We decided to follow the Django tutorials hosted by Corey Schafer on youtube and had a hardtime keeping up
since it was the first time we were using python for web-app dev.

To cut things short we were able to 

-distinguish between a user and an admin allowing the admin access to all the other users 
 pastes,profiles and personal information using another portal.
 
-all public posts can be easily accessed by everyone 

-login/logout functionality for both users and admin

-resetting the password by sending an email to the account provided during registration

-generating our own SSL cert using stunnel

-shortening urls 

-hashing password while storing in the database

-using cron jobs to make sure the database is always being backed up every 15 mins

-we have used version control extensively and our commits can viewed publically

-we have attempted to use apt visual desgin to make it more appealing
